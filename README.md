# Subvoxel-resolving algorithm
Matlab implementation and example data 

# Install
Simply download the zip file and unpack it.

# Usage

1. Run "svr_gui.m";
2. Click the "open" button on the left to load the LR series (a 3-D tiff file reqiured);
3. Change the sample parameters on the right according to your optical system by which your LRs are obtained.
4. Set the resolution-enhancement factor at the bottom, and select the super-resolution algorithm.
5. Click "start" button to run the reconstruction process.  Results of each iteration will be saved in 
    
      [voxel-super-resolution-path]/image/SR/[Algorithm]/ (automatically created).
